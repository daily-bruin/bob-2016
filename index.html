				<p>For many medical school applicants, being a doctor means caring for people who need help and fulfilling dreams of serving the community. But about 400 physicians die every year by suicide, and almost 50 percent of medical students reported feeling emotionally exhausted and less empathetic toward their patients. Though they provide help for others, many physicians-in-training face barriers in getting help for themselves.</p>
				<p>News reporter Shreya Aiyar, opinion columnist Miriam Bribiesca and photojournalist Daniel Alcazar chronicled the experiences and mental health of students at the top three University of California medical schools and what administrators are doing to help those students cope with stress, depression and thoughts of suicide.</p>

		<h1>Post 1 Title</h1>
		<p class="byline">BY SHREYA AIYAR | Daily Bruin senior staff</p>

		<p><span class="first-letter">D</span>onna Egnatios picked up a phone call at 4:30 p.m. on June 22, 2015. Seconds later, she was told her 26-year-old son was dead.</p>

		<p>The day before, Jeremy Egnatios, a third-year UC San Diego medical student, called his family to wish his dad a happy Father&rsquo;s Day, to chat about his future residency plans and to tell them he loved them.</p>

		<p>Until she read the note he left behind, Donna Egnatios didn&rsquo;t recognize his veiled farewell for what it was &ndash; the result of almost 16 years coping with depression and bipolar disorder, and his belief that his illness would make it impossible for him to have the happy life he wanted as a physician with a family.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair that somebody who has a physical illness can just say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sick today&rsquo; and no one questions it, but it&rsquo;s not the same for someone with a mental illness,&rdquo; said Donna Egnatios, paraphrasing from an email he composed but never sent. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be any different than a diabetic who has a blood sugar of 500 who says I&rsquo;m sick and I can&rsquo;t come in today.&rsquo;&rdquo; UC San Francisco, UCLA and UC San Diego are home to three top-ranked medical schools for research and primary care. Students here and around the country learn to care for patients, diagnose illness, prescribe appropriate medications and establish a rapport with their patients. But medical students pay a price: Almost 50 percent of medical students surveyed for a 2014 study in the journal Academic Medicine reported experiencing burnout, compared to about 36 percent of age-matched college graduates. People who experience burnout are more likely to feel emotionally exhausted and express cynicism and detachment towards patients, according to the 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory, a scale used to quantify and assess levels of burnout. To fulfill their roles as caregivers, some medical students like Egnatios try to bury symptoms of burnout or suicidal thoughts, cope with emotional abuse, and struggle against the stigma against expressing mental illness and feelings of burnout in the clinic.</p>

		<p class="subhead">The bottom of the ladder</p>

		<p>Three years ago, Stephan Chiu enrolled in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA as an enthusiastic student who wanted to change the world.  Chiu didn&rsquo;t know what career he wanted to pursue as an undergraduate student at UCLA. But he had spent time shadowing physicians and volunteering in the campus Care Extenders program offered by UCLA Health, so medical school seemed like a good fit.  At Geffen, Chiu quickly fell in love with his medical school experiences, like practicing suturing up a wound.</p>

		<figure>

			<figcaption class="less">here is the figcaption for the photo: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, nunc diam sed in nec, sodales hymenaeos enim eu a metus, neque tempore vestibulum aliquet odio dolor pede. Arcu molestie cursus ut, neque accumsan commodo nunc.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, I get to do something really cool, like holding a person&rsquo;s bowels in my hands,&rdquo; Chiu said. &ldquo;No one else gets to do that kind of stuff, like taking care of patients. It&rsquo;s really cool.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>But in his third year, he became exhausted after he began rotating, or training in different specialties like pediatrics and neurology, at different hospitals like Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center in Hollywood. </p>

		<p>Rotations are a traditional part of medical school training, said Susan Rosen, a primary care provider and the medical director at UC San Francisco&rsquo;s Student Health and Counseling. They expose medical students to the dozens of clinical specialties and help students gain experience for their future careers. </p>

		<p>But the clinics&rsquo; strict hierarchies fed his disillusionment, said Chiu, who agreed to be interviewed on his only day off that month.</p>

		<p>Attending physicians, who have completed their training and receive full physician salaries, sit atop the clinical ladder.</p>

		<p>Resident and intern physicians &ndash; physicians who have completed medical school but have not finished training for their specialties &ndash; occupy the next rungs of the ladder, and medical students like Chiu cling to the bottom rung, Chiu said.</p>

		<p>Chiu&rsquo;s attending physicians often did not refer to him by name. Instead, Chiu said they called for &ldquo;the med student&rdquo; when they needed something, gave him the silent treatment or caught themselves before saying something dismissive.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always like, &lsquo;Oh, I know the school tells me to treat you nice, so I&rsquo;m not going to do anything mean to you,&rsquo;&rdquo; Chiu said.</p>

		<p>During his first week of his general surgery rotation, Chiu accidentally contaminated his surgical gown by opening it up the wrong way. As a medical student, Chiu said he didn&rsquo;t know much &ndash; he barely knew how to wear his gown and gloves properly, but was thrown into an environment where everybody around him was good at it already. </p>

		<p>A nurse harshly reprimanded Chiu, humiliating him in front of his resident physician, Chiu said. He realized his vision of being a doctor clashed with exhaustion from the long hours, stress and absence of support from clinical faculty and staff.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I have all these sick patients, but I&rsquo;m also really tired and I just want to go home to take care of myself,&rdquo; Chiu said. &ldquo;It sucks to say, but (I became) more cynical as the year went on.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Rosen said first- and second-year medical students spend time with each other in large lecture-based classes, study together and talk about their problems. </p>

		<p>But students can burn out more easily in their third years because they begin to work in clinics and take fewer classes with large groups of classmates, Rosen said. They can become isolated with different rotation times and locations than their friends, and they move from hospital to hospital when their rotations change.</p>

		<p>Constantly moving from hospital to hospital can block students&rsquo; access to care and therapy, resulting in problems like social anxiety and frustration, said Lance Raynor, a mental health provider at UC San Francisco&rsquo;s Student Health and Counseling.</p>

		<p>Chiu said he felt the effects of isolation firsthand: He was not able to see his friends or family for days on end, and he also could not easily form meaningful relationships with his medical teams because he moved to a different team the next month.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perpetually on the bottom rung of the team, and you&rsquo;re switching every month to a different team,&rdquo; Chiu said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very stressful.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Some medical students do not express frustration, stress and anxiety in case they are formally diagnosed with a mental illness that may go on their medical records, said Jessica Lloyd, the associate program director for the UCLA pediatric residency program.</p>

		<p>Students may be frightened into thinking mental illness will affect their chances at competitive residency programs, Lloyd added. The California medical licensure application asks residency applicants to disclose any mental illness that could hinder their ability to treat patients, and states that it will decide if a student is eligible for a medical license based on the severity of the medical condition.</p>

		<p>Lloyd said students&rsquo; stress in thinking about their futures and their lack of time to go to therapy appointments create barriers to care with no easy fix.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We have to care for our caretakers now,&rdquo; Lloyd said.</p>

		<p class="subhead">Caring for the caregiver</p>

		<p>Jeremy Egnatios grew up watching his father move in and out of the hospital because of complications from a liver transplant.</p>

		<p>Egnatios&rsquo; mother Donna Egnatios said he assumed a protective role when he realized his father could die at any moment, and he took his role of caring for her and his two sisters seriously. </p>

		<figure class="right">
			<h1 style="visibility:hidden;height:1px;margin:0;" id="">image header</h1>

		</figure>

		<p>But Donna Egnatios said Jeremy Egnatios felt discouraged from pursuing his dream of caring for others because he believed his symptoms of depression and mania, associated with bipolar disorder, would prevent him from balancing them with his demanding physician schedule.</p>

		<p>Egnatios withheld his symptoms from his family for years because he did not want to add to his parents&rsquo; stress, Donna Egnatios said. He was formally diagnosed with the disorder after his undergraduate years at Arizona State University. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;He wanted to cure people and take care of people (as a doctor),&rdquo; Donna Egnatios said. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t one to talk about his issues or problems.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Though Jeremy Egnatios briefly attended pharmacy school, his mother said his pharmacy school professors recognized his intelligence and caring personality and pushed him to apply for medical school instead. </p>

		<p>At UC San Diego, Jeremy Egnatios never hesitated to help other students with their schoolwork or through their own emotional slumps, Donna Egnatios said. He also juggled 10 projects at a student-run free clinic and worked on seven research projects, while studying for his exams. Jerry Egnatios, Jeremy Egnatios&rsquo; father, said his son did not disclose his bipolar diagnosis to the university because he worried faculty and his peers would view him differently, or that the diagnosis would not fit his caregiver personality. Most of all, he feared the formal disclosure would affect his future employment as a resident physician, Donna Egnatios said. Carolyn Kelly, associate dean for admissions and academic affairs, declined to comment on Jeremy Egnatios&rsquo; care through the university, citing the need to protect students&rsquo; personal and medical information.</p>

		<p>Rosen said some medical students aren&rsquo;t comfortable telling supervisors about their therapy sessions and appointments, fearing it may affect their performance grades and letters of recommendation for residency programs.</p>

		<p>Jessica Chow, a fourth-year UC San Francisco medical student, said students are also afraid to take days off and mention mental and emotional hardship to their attending physicians. She added students don&rsquo;t want to push more work onto their teams, or want others to think they are weak or shirking their responsibilities.</p>

		<p>Donna Egnatios said Jeremy Egnatios began to lie to his attending physicians about why he could not show up to work &ndash; he would say he had a fever, instead of telling them that his depressive states prevented him from getting out of bed that day.  &ldquo;He never felt comfortable telling them he just was too depressed to go to school that day,&rdquo; Donna Egnatios said.</p>

		<p>Jeremy Egnatios attempted suicide in March 2014, injecting himself with an overdose of insulin, and was transported to a UC San Diego-affiliated hospital. Donna Egnatios said UC San Diego deemed him temporarily unfit for medical school based on its technical standards, which state candidates must have the physical and emotional stamina to function under stressful situations. Donna Egnatios said only a few people knew of her son&rsquo;s bipolar disorder diagnosis after his suicide attempt &ndash; Kelly and a few of his close friends.</p>

		<p>Egnatios&rsquo; physicians placed him into intense therapy and psychiatric rehabilitation sessions, and Donna Egnatios said he learned to cope with his mood swings by painting, establishing regular sleep patterns and writing poetry.</p>

		<p>When he was discharged, Jeremy Egnatios was six months behind the rest of his classmates. The university let him return, though, and he was given the option to catch up because of his extensive research in laboratories and experience with the student-run clinic. </p>

		<p>At the end of his third year, Egnatios rotated through a psychiatry clinic &ndash; he spoke with patients who said their physicians locked them in wards and quarantined them for hours at a time. In his note, Egnatios wrote that he became terrified of meeting the same fate, of having medical school taken away from him because he couldn&rsquo;t control his mood swings, Donna Egnatios said.</p>

		<p>Jeremy Egnatios committed suicide in June. His sister Tara Egnatios found his credit card, driver&rsquo;s license, checkbook and car keys sitting on his kitchen counter. A note nearby said to keep the cash, pay the rent and not worry about anything.</p>

		<p>Donna Egnatios said Jeremy Egnatios left a legacy of care and kindness at UC San Diego. The comments left on Egnatios&rsquo; obituary page, many from fellow students and professors, mentioned instances like his offering to help younger students study for their exams, though he had his own exams coming up, or supporting other students through their periods of anxiety or depression.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If his death can help other people speak up and let the schools know they&rsquo;re struggling, I think those kind of things might make a difference,&rdquo; Donna Egnatios said. &ldquo;(Jeremy Egnatios) didn&rsquo;t get there, but there are enough other people that can make it through and finish what he started.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="subhead">Healing from the stress</p>

		<p>Daniel Herrador disliked the mask of false happiness he had to wear when he was having a bad day.</p>

		<p>The third-year UC San Francisco medical student was usually a cheerful, enthusiastic student who would throw himself into clinical rotations with gusto. He would participate in hands-on workshops, wearing thick, prickly gloves to understand how an elderly patient with nerve damage ties shoelaces, and regularly asked how his resident and attending physicians how he could help with tricky cases.</p>

		<p>But when Herrador couldn&rsquo;t keep a smile on his face, like after an argument with his romantic partner or when he was sleep-deprived, he found it impossible to be at his best for a medical team who depended on &ndash; and graded &ndash; him. </p>

		<p>Herrador said a bonus of trying hard in clinic, in addition to learning valuable information about patient care, was receiving honors, or an honorable distinction on the student&rsquo;s evaluation at the end of a rotation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Somebody who gets honors doesn&rsquo;t ever show he&rsquo;s not engaged that day,&rdquo; Herrador said. To relieve the stress, Herrador said he attends as many practices for his softball team as he can. Herrador added he&rsquo;s missed games because of weekend hospital shifts and doesn&rsquo;t know whether he can continue with the team during residency, but he promised himself he would focus on one non-medical activity when medical school became tough.</p>

		<p>Raynor said he also believes in letting students briefly distract themselves from medical school for a change in pace. He added some UC San Francisco students have never even toured the city &ndash; though they&rsquo;ve lived in the city for two or three quarters, they haven&rsquo;t seen the Bay Bridge light up or gone to Golden Gate Park.</p>

		<p>As part of therapy, he assigns students to visit landmarks like Coit Tower on top of Telegraph Hill in San Francisco during free weekends. Rosen, who also sees medical students to address their complaints of burnout, said when the students come back, they have broken their routine long enough to feel refreshed about going back to their studies or clinical work.</p>

		<p>Nick Orozco, a fourth-year UC San Francisco student, turns to meditation to destress. Roxanne Vasquez, a fourth-year UCLA medical student and well-being representative on the medical student council, plans socializing workshops and participates in big sibling-little sibling events, in which students are grouped into families.</p>

		<p>For Herrador, it&rsquo;s the bigger picture that matters &ndash; finding comfort in his identity and remembering who he is throughout the stress of medical school. He wears a small rainbow stripe at the bottom of his medical badge, symbolizing his identification with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.</p>

		<p>Some of his LGBT classmates refuse to wear the stripe because Herrador said they fear discrimination by supervisors or patients. Herrador, however, said he finds solace in turning to his identity, partner, softball team and friends during difficult and stressful times. &ldquo;Doctors are expected to never get sick,&rdquo; Herrador said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re expected to never take time off, to always give, give, give. But at the same time, we&rsquo;re people too.&rdquo; </p>

		<h1>A Hidden Culture of Medical Student Mistreatment</h1>
		<p class="byline">By Miriam Bribiesca | Daily Bruin senior staff</p>

		<p><span class="first-letter">Y</span>ou&rsquo;re not a true Bruin if half your friends weren&rsquo;t pre-med students when they started at UCLA, only to realize it wasn&rsquo;t for them. But for those that do make it, medical school represents another beast altogether.</p>

		<figure class="right">
			<h1 style="visibility:hidden;height:1px;margin:0;" id="">image header</h1>
			<img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/05/travel_illo_final_prev.jpg">

		</figure>

		<p>The first two years of medical school are difficult, to say the least. Students are constantly needing to digest tons of information, learn to navigate an entirely new social scene, and are suddenly expected to also master their social skills once their clinical rotations begin.</p>

		<p>Or, as Nicholas Orozco, a fourth year medical student at UCSF medical school, would say, &ldquo;they often describe it in medical school as trying to drink water from a fire hydrant.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>But unlike undergraduate work, where the classes generally get easier the further one goes along, medical school only gets tougher. By the time a student reaches third year clinical rotations, stress can reach critical levels. </p>

		<p>But chances are, you won&rsquo;t hear much about this, which isn&rsquo;t unusual. Overworking seems to be part of the culture instilled from the beginning of medical school, and many seem unwilling to talk, as if they&rsquo;ll violate some sort of unwritten code. Hence, breakdowns, burnout and mistreatment are topics rarely mentioned when thinking about medical school and the path towards becoming a doctor.</p>

		</blockquote>

		<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. Burnout and depression amongst medical students can be prevented if medical schools first acknowledged the the stigma around mental health issues and work with staff to ensure that medical students are being treated appropriately. </p>

		<p>One solution would be just to cap working hours all together, including third-year students. In 2003 resident hours were capped to 80 hours a week because of increasing burnout rates. But when it comes to third-year medical students, no weekly cap is specified. </p>



		<p>But even if there is a cap, an attitude adjustment needs to come as well. For instance, Stephan Chiu, a third-year medical student at the UCLA David Geffen school, spoke about the harsh treatment he received while in rotations. He was humiliated in front of his entire team and often scolded by nurses for making mistakes on procedures he wasn&rsquo;t taught in the first place. </p>

		<p> &ldquo;You have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing, and nobody takes the time to teach you,&rdquo; Chiu said. &ldquo;The first week or two, I was a mess. Nurses were constantly telling me to get out of the way... they accept you because you&rsquo;re there, but they treat you like a ghost.&rdquo; </p>


		<blockquote class="right">
			Nurses were constantly telling me to get out of the way... they accept you because you&rsquo;re there, but they treat you like a ghost.
			<!--<aside>By Firstname Lastname</aside>-->
		</blockquote>

		<p>Daniel Herrador, a third-year UCSF medical student, who also had a similar experience, said he feels invisible the majority of the time during medical rotations. &ldquo;Third year medical students are off to the side. It is getting better, but there have been situations where people don&rsquo;t really address you by your name, or they don&rsquo;t even try &#8230; Either you are expected to perform 150 percent or they won&rsquo;t remember that you&rsquo;re even there,&rdquo; he added.   This derogatory treatment can start a downwards spiral, especially when students might be struggling with other problems already. Susan Rosen, a primary care provider and medical director at UCSF, said many students who seek mental health are dealing with personal problems that range from family issues, to romantic relationships.   This cut-throat culture in medical school isn&rsquo;t a surprise. For decades, previous generations have perceived burnout as disgraceful and, while acceptance for students&rsquo; limitations has improved, many students are still ashamed to admit they need help.</p>



		<p>&ldquo;I think the stigma is less now than it used to be, and there is a lot more emphasis now that it is okay to come in and say you are burned out. That would not have been acceptable when I was in medical school. You wouldn&rsquo;t say you were burnout. That meant you weren&rsquo;t tough enough,&rdquo; said Doctor Margaret Stuber, Assistant Dean for Well-being and Career Development for the David Geffen School of Medicine, after being asked about her experience in medical school.</p>

		<p>And broader societal shifts aren&rsquo;t helping.</p>

		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>The medical health system is in short supply of care providers, and to fulfill this demand means that communication becomes an afterthought, leaving instances of abuse unnoticed. Especially now after Obamacare has been implemented, medical school functions more like a machine that spits out medical students. Hence, fulfilling this shortage of primary doctors naturally leads to a fast-paced environment where personal problems are ignored, pushing students into the shadows. Essentially, lack of intimate conversations in such a fast-moving culture harbors a perfect breeding ground for mistreatment. </p>

		


		<p>It&rsquo;s true that medical schools are trying to address the lack of dialogue on mental health through mental programs and campaigns, such as the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Okay&rdquo; campaign at UCSF and CAPS at UCLA and &ldquo;Out Of the Shadows&rdquo; walk at UCSD, but it&rsquo;s not enough. </p>

		<p>These programs and events are undoubtedly important, but the root of this epidemic can only be tackled if physicians and working doctors are also made aware of the commonality of mistreatment and burnout amongst medical students. A solution to this disconnect between medical students and physicians, again, lies in not only caring after staff but also creating procedures to facilitate honest communication within a medical team that promotes high integration of medical students within the team roles.</p>

		<p>Struggling in medical school is a given, but the majority of the time, preventing maltreatment from occurring is harder than it seems particularly when current efforts focus on physicians rather than early on. Reaching out to faculty members is encouraged at all medical schools, but the reality of this actually happening is still in its developing stages.</p>

		
		<figure class="right">

		</figure>

		<p>Instituting change in a culture that has instilled toughness and competition for years can be hard, but just accepting the way things are now and disregarding abuse and fatigue as common will only foster new physicians who are more prone to suffer from burnout, defeating the main purpose of becoming a doctor which is to help and aid people in need.   While it is not only the mindset of incoming medical students, new physicians, and installed doctors that should be changed and analyzed, the UC medical school system should, to the very least, begin a conversation amongst all UC medical schools on how to improve and implement mental wellness amongst students who will carry the future of health care.</p>
